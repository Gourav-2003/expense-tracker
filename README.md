Personal Expense Tracker
This is my  Python project, built to help me learn and practice with Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, matplotlib and NumPy. The Personal Expense Tracker lets you log, analyze, and visualize your personal expenses easily using a CSV file for data storage.

Features:

1.Add, view, and update expenses with details like date, category, amount, and notes.
2.Analyze total spending, spending by category, and highest/average expenses.
3.Generate simple visualizations (bar, line, and pie charts) to see your spending patterns.
4.Experiment-friendly code with lots of room to customize and learn more.

Why I built this:
I wanted a beginner-friendly project after studying Python’s data libraries. This tracker was the perfect way to practice reading/writing files, grouping and summarizing data, and even plotting charts—all with tools I just learned.

Feel free to check out the code and try it yourself, especially if you’re just starting out with Python data analysis!
